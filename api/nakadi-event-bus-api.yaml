  title: Nakadi Event Bus API Definition
  description: |
    -----------
    Definitions
    -----------
    Nakadi at its core aims at being a generic and content-agnostic event broker with a convenient API.
    In doing this, Nakadi abstracts away, as much as possible, details of the backing messaging
    infrastructure. The single currently supported messaging infrastructure is Kafka (Kinesis is planned
    for the future).

    In Nakadi every Event has an EventType, and a **stream** of Events is exposed for each registered
    EventType.

    An EventType defines properties relevant for the operation of its associated stream, namely:

    * The **schema** of the Event of this EventType. The schema defines the accepted format of Events of an
    EventType and will be, if so desired, enforced by Nakadi. Usually Nakadi will respect the schema for
    the EventTypes in accordance to how an owning Application defines them.
    **Note:** *Currently the specification of the schema must be pushed into Nakadi on EventType creation;
    in the future, assuming that Applications will expose the schema for its owned resources, Nakadi might
    support fetching the schema directly from them.*
    Nakadi might define globally minimal schema compliance requirements (i.e. some fields that must be
    present on schemas of all EventTypes).

    * The expected **validation** and **enrichment** procedures upon reception of an Event.
    (*TODO: define validation and enrichment*)

    * The **ordering** expectations of Events in this stream. (*TODO: define ordering not in terms of
    partitioning*)

    Except for defined enrichment rules, Nakadi will never manipulate the content of any Event.

    Clients of Nakadi can be grouped in 2 categories: **Application owners** and **Clients** (clients in turn
    are both **Producers** and **Consumers** of Events). Application owners interact with Nakadi via the
    **Schema Registry API** for the definition of EventTypes, while Clients via the **Stream API** for
    submission and reception of Events. A low level **Topic API** is available, providing full control and
    responsibility of position tracking and partitioning (and therefore ordering) to the Clients.

    The consumption of Events proceeds via the establishment of a named **Subscription** to an EventType.
    Subscriptions are persistent relationships from an Application (which might have several instances) and
    the stream of an EventType, whose consumption tracking is managed by Nakadi, freeing Consumers from any
    responsibility in tracking the current position on a Stream.


    Scope and status of this document
    -------------------------------

    The present API specification is in **draft** state and is subject to change.

    In this document, ready for review are included:
    * The Schema Registry API, including configuration possibilities for the Schema, Validation, Enrichment
    and Partitioning of Events, and their effects on reception of Events.

    * The Stantardised event format (see #/definitions/Event) (Note: at a later moment this will be
    configurable and not be inherent part of this API).

    * Topic API (low level).

    Other aspects of the Event Bus are at this moment to be defined and otherwise specificied, not included
    in this version of this specification.

    Notable omissions here are:
    * The contract between Nakadi and clients in the context of the high-level API (i.e. the process for
    clients to establish subscriptions).

    * Submission of events to topics in batched manner.

    * Validation and enrichment procedures.

    * Security scopes (OAuth) for the different operations

    * Validation and Enrichment Strategies available in Nakadi are out of this document an can be consulted
    in an external document (TBD link to document).

        Creates a new `EventType`.

        **Implementation note:** The creation of an EventType implicitly creates the structures in the
        backing messaging implementation needed for the reception and persistency of the Events. Considering
        that at this time only Kafka is used, this corresponds to the creation of a Topic. If so desired,
        clients can interact directly with the topic using the low level API (for existing restrictions see
        the corresponding methods on the topic-api).

        The fields validation-strategies, enrichment-strategies and partition-resolution-strategy have all an
        effect on the incoming Event of this EventType. For its impacts on the reception of events please
        consult the Event submission API methods.

        * Validation strategies define an array of `EventValidationStrategy` to be evaluated on reception of
        an `Event` of this `EventType`. Details of usage can be found in an external document (TBD link to
        document).
        **Notes**: Some EventValidationStrategies might support additional parameters. The behaviour is
        specific to each strategy and one is suggested to consult its `doc` field for detailes of operation.
        The default `SchemaValidationStrategy` supports passing fields to be ignored if the qualifier matches
        the input.

        * TDB Enrichment strategy

        * TDB Partition resolution strategy

        * The schema of an `EventType` is defined as an `EventTypeSchema`. Currently only json-schema is
        supported.

        Following violations are enforced. Not meeting them will fail the request with a 422 Unprocessable
        entity (details are provided in the Problem object):

        * Event name on creation not begin unique.

        * Using `EventTypeSchema.type` other than json-schema or passing a `EventTypeSchema.schema`
        that is invalid with respect to the schema's type.

        * Referring any of Validation, Enrichment or Partitioning strategies that does not exist or whose
        parameterization is deemed invalid.

        Nakadi MIGHT impose necessary schema, validation and enrichment minimal configurations that MUST be
        followed by all EventTypes (examples include: validation rules to match the schema; enriching every
        Event with the reception date-type; adhering to a set of schema fields that are mandatory for all
        EventTypes). **The mechanism to set and inspect such rules is not defined at this time and might not
        be exposed in the API.**

        Publishes one or more events of this EventType.

        Reception of Events will always respect the configuration of its EventType w.r.t. validation,
        enrichment and partitioning. The steps performed on reception of incoming message are:

        1. Every validation rule specified in the `EventType` will be checked in order against the incoming
        Events. Validation rules are evaluated in the order they are defined and the Event is **rejected**
        in the first case of failure with a status of 400 Bad request. If the offending validation rule
        provides information about the violation it will be included in the Problem response.
        If the `EventType` defines schema validation it will be performed at this moment.
        **TBD behaviour in case of violation within a stream of events**)

        1. Once the validation succeeded, the content of the Event is updated according to the enrichment
        rules in the order the rules are defined in the `EventType`.
        No preexisting value might be changed (even if added by an enrichment rule). Violations on this will
        force the immediate **rejection** of the Event with a 409 Conflict status. The invalid overwrite
        attempt will be included in the respose's Problem object.

        1. The incoming Event's relative ordering is evaluated according to the rule on the
        `EventType`. Failure to evaluate the rule will **reject** the Event.
        **Restriction**: POSTing Events based on its `EventType` requires it to have a
        `PartitioningStrategy` defined. Violating this condition will produce a 405 Not allowed.

      description: |
        Starts a stream delivery for the specified partitions of the given topic.

        The event stream is formated as a sequence of `EventStreamBatch`es separated by `\n`. Each
        `EventStreamBatch` constains a chunk of Events and a `Cursor` pointing to the end of the chunk (i.e.
        last delivered Event).
        If streaming for several distinct partitions, each one is a independent `EventStreamBatch`.

        The initialization of a stream can be parameterized in terms of size of each chunk, timeout for
        flushing each chunk, total amount of delivered Events and total time for the duration of the stream.

        Nakadi will keep a streaming connection open even if there are no events to be delivered. In this
        case the timeout for the flushing of each chunk will still apply and the `EventStreamBatche`s will
        contain only the Cursor pointing to the same offset. This can be treated as a keep-alive control for
        some load balancers.

        The tracking of the current position in the partitions and of which partitions is being read is in
        the responsibility of the client.
        No commits are needed.

      **Note** The Event definition will be externalized in future versions of this document.

      A basic payload of an Event. The actual schema is dependent on the information configured for the
      EventType, as is its enforcement (see POST /event-types). Setting of metadata properties are
      dependent on the configured enrichment as well.

      For explanation on default configurations of validation and enrichment, see documentatin of
      `EventType.type`.

      For concrete examples of what will be enforced by Nakadi see the objects BusinessEvent and
      DataChangeEvent below.

          The value set will influence, if not set otherwise, the default set of validation-strategies,
          enrichment-strategies, and the effective_schema in the following way:

          - `undefined`: No predefined changes apply. `effective_schema` is exactly the same as the
            `EventTypeSchema`.
            Default validation_strategy for this `EventType` is `[{name: 'schema-validation'}]`.

          - `data`: Events of this type will be DataChangeEvents. `effective_schema` contains `metadata`, and
            adds fields `data_op` and `data_type`. The passed EventTypeSchema defines the schema of `data`.
            Default validation_strategy for this `EventType` is `[{name: 'datachange-schema-validation'}]`.

          - `business`: Events of this type will be BusinessEvents. `effective_schema` contains `metadata`
            and any additionally defined properties passed in the `EventTypeSchema` directly on top level of
            the Event. If name conflicts arise, creation of this EventType will be rejected.
            Default validation_strategy for this `EventType` is `[{name: 'schema-validation'}]`.

          The generation of thie value happens on creation of the `EventType` and is influenced by the
          `EventType.type`.

  EventEnrichmentStrategy:
    description: |
      Defines a rule for transformation of an incoming Event. No existing fields might be modified. In
      practice this is used to set automatically values in the Event upon reception (i.e. set a reception
      timestamp on the Event).

      Rules might require additional parameters; see the `doc` field of the existing rules for details. See
      GET /registry/enrichment-rules for a list of available rules.
